## How to struggle with CSS selector?

In the Chrome Developer Tools, type the following in the console.

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll("div:has(> h2 a[href$='?tab=achievements'])");
```

Then expand the `NodeList(2)`, and hover to them, chrome tells us where the element is.

## Carefully handle adjusted JSON schema

[src/manifestSchemaAdjusted.json](src/manifestSchemaAdjusted.json)

The filled enum is not perfect. It should contain URIs. But you can update as following steps

1. Download the base schema from <https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/blob/fd34ef2aa89e5007ed67d6844f1519cfec75678c/src/schemas/json/chrome-manifest.json>
1. Download and extract and formats the <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/permission_warnings/> as `tmp/scrape.html`
1. `rg '<tr id="([^"]+)">' -or '"$1",'  tmp/scrape.html` will show the most definitions, but not correct, and it includes non enum like URL patterns
